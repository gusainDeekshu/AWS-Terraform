# 🟢 Show the current workspace
terraform workspace show

# 📜 List all workspaces
terraform workspace list

# ➕ Create a new workspace
terraform workspace new <workspace-name>

# 🔁 Switch to an existing workspace
terraform workspace select <workspace-name>

# ❌ Delete a workspace (you can't delete the current one)
terraform workspace delete <workspace-name>

# 💡 Notes:
# - Workspaces isolate the state file, not the actual infrastructure.
# - Useful for managing environments like dev, staging, and prod with the same code.
# - Each workspace stores its own terraform.tfstate file under `.terraform/`.

# 📂 Example usage:
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace select dev
terraform apply
terraform workspace select staging
terraform apply
